# Hacker School Projects

I had an amazing time at [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/). Here are most of the things I worked on.

* [Trie Data Structure](https://github.com/crockeo/treestuff) (Haskell, Python, C) with [Cerek](https://github.com/crockeo)
* [Image Blurring](https://gitlab.com/yamadapc/image-blur) (Haskell) with [Pedro](https://github.com/yamadapc)
* Tiny bit of Rust (getting the time) -- with Pedro
* Built a Mouse! Learned lots about HID and mouse drivers.
    * Mouse can act as a Mouse (randomly moves around), keyboard (prints out a character on button click), or serial device (I can listen to when the button is clicked on the mouse). Probably project that took the longest time.
* MIT Splash - [8 hrs teaching](https://esp.mit.edu/teach/teachers/theicfire/bio.html) High School students: 
    * Wizardry through cooking and science (How to make sugar glass)
    * How to throw a Frisbee
    * Painting with Computers: Recent Advancements in Magic
    * Puzzles and Physics ([Question and Solution](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/multimedia/mathematical-impressions-multimedia/the-bicycle-pulling-puzzle/)) -- really love this
* Hack Princeton -- Built [Brunchly](http://brunchly.meteor.com)
* [Hella Fast Command Line Navigation](http://blog.chaselambda.com/2014/11/07/hella-fast-command-line-navigation.html)
* OS - Built a Network driver for MIT's 6.828 - it's [lab 6](http://pdosnew.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/labs/lab6/)
* [Kernel Module to get my keyboard working](http://blog.chaselambda.com/2014/10/09/apple-keyboard-on-linux-3.8.html)
* Made a [blog](http://blog.chaselambda.com)
* Built a [debugger in Python](https://github.com/theicfire/pygdb)
    * Taught me about ptrace, how debuggers work in general, and cython! (Not cpython)
* [zulip.chaselambda.com](http://zulip.chaselambda.com)
* [makefiletutorial.com](http://makefiletutorial.com)
* [vimsheet.com](http://vimsheet.com)
* Unicode! [whatisunicode.com](http://whatisunicode.com)
    * Spent quite a bit of time diving into Unicode and encodings. Still need to write up about this.
* [Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)
    * Also learned about Ipython notebooks
    * Went up to ch4 I believe. Need to go back to make sure i understand the subtleties
* Visited [NYC Resistor](http://www.nycresistor.com/) Hackerspace
    * Amazingly wonderful. Met [Olivia Bar](http://oliviabarr.com/artwork/3495751_Not_A_Camera.html) there (great artist!): 
    * Beagleboard has coprocessors! One project used these to make a massive LED cube
* bit of python 3 and pyenv
* Bit of Elixir with Florian
* topcoder
* Eudyptula Challenge
* Node Promises with Pedro
* [LD_PRELOAD](http://blog.chaselambda.com/2014/11/25/how-tmux-starts-up-an-adventure-with-linux-tools.html) w/ Julia Evans

* [172 project instructions](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2010/) + wiki changes
