# Not great/Can improve
- Time sinks
  - Decisions and planning
    - I’ve been playing with one idea: make decisions faster and use the saved time to make that decision a good decision (this works great for smallish decisions). But I still need more strategies!
    - Sometimes writing emails/messages take a real long time
  - Over optimizing, especially when money is involved
    - Data backup
      - Backing up google photos (concerned Google is the only owner of all my photos)
      - Related: getting dropbox under 100gb
    - Bike (and selling my other one)
    - Bluetooth trackers
    - Bash infinite history attempts
  - Researching people and things rabbit holes
    - Youtube stars
    - Linkedin/Github
    - Crypto
    - Tesla
  - Not getting out of bed quickly
- Eating more than I need (weight is fine, but I just eat until I’m really full)
- Ways I wish I could improve
  - More “risk” taking
    - i.e. More cold emails
    - i.e. Give free hugs
  - Reduce worrying about pleasing others
  - Being more confident/outgoing in certain situations
    - Improv could help
  - Would love to figure out what “work” I should do. I’ve been playing around with the idea of working in new industries for a short time, but haven’t done much research here
