I left my job 2 months ago and I've been exploring the world around me. Here's what I've been up to!

* Health
    * I've done some sort of physical activity every day. This has been a top priority of mine
    * Running -- there's a track nearby that's been wonderful. I used to run track in high school, and it feels like an old friend. I've gotten much faster!
    * Biking
    * Sleeping well!
    * Being kind to myself, and noticing when I'm not
    * Bought a new set of [toothbrushes](https://www.amazon.com/Nimbus%C2%AE-Microfine%C2%AE-Toothbrush-REGULAR-Colors/dp/B005LB75NI/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1510379167&sr=8-3&keywords=nimbus+toothbrush). They're my new favorite
* Coliving
    * I've been living in a wonderful community for 5 months now
    * Cooking once a week, for 2 hours
    * Made bread for the first time
    * Gardening! I planted seeds for the first time. They haven't yet flourished, but I have hope.
    * Lots of time hanging out with people and eating dinner with them
        * Breakfasts are often my favorite
    * I also do what I can to help out -- cleaning, organizing things, and helping out with a transition to Slack
    * We had an event called "roomwarming" where everyone shows off their room to the house. I made crepes and got the house to play the game Sardines
    * Set up a new router
    * Customized my room to hang my skateboard and bike, and installed shelves
    * Our house got 3 new kittens! I try to see them most days. I sometimes just brush my teeth next to them.

* Reading a few random magazines, books (I randomly saw a new book by John Krakaur, who's one of my favorite authors. I wasn't interested in getting into the gritty details of Mormon Fundamentalism , but the first 20 pages were fascinating.)
* Podcasts
    * One about the Stethoscope
    * One about how we're almost able to synthesize fake videos and audio of people. That is, we could take a speech by Obama and change what he says. The implications are pretty terrifying.
    * One about the invention of basketball
    * One about how McDonald's changed their french fry recipe in 1990, and now makes worse french fries
* Writing this blog post!
* Software Design
    * I've been learning software design principals from a friend of mine in Boston. Most recently, I put together a design case study of a popular open source repository.
* I've been taking two classes at a nearby college: Programming Languages and Databases
* Small Tasks
    * Diagnosed the check engine light and SRS light on my car
    * Bought a monitor on craigslist
    * Bought a bike on craigslist (and got locked out of my car, eek)
* "Fun" things
    * I did a scavenger hunt with some friends.
    * Various house gatherings and parties
    * Catching up with friends
    * Went to my first EDM concert
    * Fountain Hopping
    * Iceland for 10 days
    * White water rafting
    * Burmese food for the first time
    * Various parties and gatherings at friends houses
    * I'm visiting Boston this weekend to hang out with friends! It took a decent amount of planning.
* I went to my first conference. It was free, and unsurprisingly uninteresting, but there happened to be another really neat medical conference going on right next to it!
* Learning Adobe Illustrator -- about 8 hours in total
* Art! I used colored pencils for the first time in over 6 years

* Science Hackathon
* Visited my friend at a nearby college he's teaching at
* Experimenting with coworking -- I have a few friends that also don't have full time jobs, and I've been learning what it's like to work with them
* Beginning to learn Piano. I've practiced on 7 different occasions over the past 2 months (or so my notes say).
* A group of friends and I have each built our own 6-week curriculum to follow. Mine focused on learning more about jobs. We met once a week to present our progress.
* I went to a yearly gathering at the Internet Archive
* Investigating the life of being a software contractor
    * I did 28 hours of contracting for my past company
    * I filled out some profiles to help get matched with other companies
    * I talked to a friend that's been contracting for 2 years, and has been loving it
* Things I have purposefully not been doing
    * Reading any kind of political news
    * Reading my facebook news feed (I've disabled this for 2.5 years now)
