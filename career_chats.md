Hi, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here! I‚Äôm conducting informational interviews to get a survey of people's career paths.

# About Me

My software background is quite diverse. I‚Äôm an MIT engineer who‚Äôs worked on electronics (Google/Nest, Planet, Skip Scooters, Boosted Boards) as well as popular online tools (Indeed, Quizlet, Stripe). Most recently, I was the founding engineer at a Mighty and Playground, where we built a Chrome-derived browser that later pivoted into building foundational image models.

I recently left my job in order to give myself time to explore what I should work on next. My goal since high school has been to have some meaningful positive impact on the world, which can manifest through forms like education, climate action, biological risk mitigation, AI risk reduction, local community support, or financial philanthropy. I could either directly work on that now, or build more skills, knowledge, and connections that would help me do that in the future. My next step is to either join an organization or start a company -- this is how open minded my exploration stage is currently at!

You can learn more about me [here](/about/).

# My Hopes for the Chats

Right now, I‚Äôm intensely curious about learning about people and their careers. Some example questions:

- What have been your favorite things you‚Äôve worked on in the past?
- Where do you want to go in the future? Why?
- What are the characteristics of the people you‚Äôve most enjoyed working with?
- How has your work changed with the advent of AI?
- What would you do if you had more time in your day?
- What advice would you have liked to give your younger self?

I also love meeting people through the magic of the internet. I‚Äôve met dozens of fantastic people through cold messages, and have had the chance to meet some of these connections in person. Feel free to ask me more about this!

# Work I‚Äôve been up to recently

Here‚Äôs a few of the directions I‚Äôve been going since I left my job:

- Shadowing a friend who‚Äôs running a software business in the Solar sector. This inspired me to potentially work on some niche business software product.
- Building a news reading tool (slightly similar to Google Reader) and interviewing people about their news reading experiences. This is mostly for fun and learning, and not yet a direct company I want to make.
- Supporting a bio-risk project for a friend in DC
- This project!

Thanks for considering this weird proposal! Every conversation is immensely valuable to me, and I'm grateful for your time.
