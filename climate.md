Hi, I’m glad you’re here! I’m conducting informational interviews of people working at companies that are helping to mitigate climate impact. I’m sharing this document with you to elaborate on my intentions for these conversations.

My overarching goal is to join some sort of organization where I can meaningfully contribute to reducing greenhouse gasses.

In pursuit of that, here are some **general things I’m hoping to learn** from the folks I chat with:
- How does each person measure their impact, if at all? What does success look like to them?
- What are people’s general feelings about climate work, if they’ve been at it for a while?
- What are some promising but under resourced areas in climate?
- Among a variety of companies, what are the big challenges each of them is facing?
- Where is the majority of people’s time spent day to day at their companies?
- What are some inspiring individuals or companies that exist that I’m not aware of? Or people that might be excited to help me find answers?

I also have many **specific questions**. Here are a few to give you some flavor:
- The utility [rate case process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_ratemaking) seems quite inefficient and complicated. What are the main possible improvements, and how impactful would they be?
- Grid storage seems like an important component of increased renewable energy. What are the main limitations to more rapidly deploying these? I have a few guesses, but I’m not sure.
- How should I think about $/ton of CO2e? What is the typical price environmental policies use, if anything?
- PG&E was about to shut down their diablo canyon power plant, why could they not overcome the political headwinds from scared people? What did they try to do to fix this? Did they really care about keeping it open?
- Sequestration: What are the most promising paths towards making sequestration far cheaper?
- The forestry climate initiatives seem very fragmented. What’s going on? What are the biggest challenges this industry faces? What are some of the most promising organizations? What’s a reasonable $/ton co2e for planting trees and keeping them thriving?
- With respect to residential and commercial buildings in the US, it seems the predominant way to decarbonize this sector is through policy. I’ve seen many creative solutions to this problem but their largely solving the long-tail problems.
- What are some of the most promising international decarbonization initiatives? I’ve mainly focused on the US in my research.
- A typical way to advocate for a policy is by contacting a representative's office, where their secretary records your stance. How effective is this approach, what importance do politicians assign to it, and why aren't there more advanced methods for collecting constituent opinions?


**FAQ**
- Why isn’t reading and listening to podcasts enough to answer these questions?
  - I wish it could. But in my experience it’s blindingly obvious that talking with people gives me insights that would be really challenging (or impossible) to find otherwise.
- How many people have you talked to so far?
  - 30ish as of April 2023
- How long should we chat for?
  - An hour is ideal but 30 minutes is fine too
- What have you learned so far?
  - I have many notes I’d be happy to share.
